WeatherMap is a Qt/C++ desktop application that visualizes Finnish weather data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) on top of a rendered map of Finland.  
The application follows a clean, layered architecture (View → ViewModel → Domain ← Data) and includes a comprehensive test suite.

## Features

- Map rendered from GeoJSON (`resources/map/fin.geojson`)
- City names and coordinates loaded from JSON (`resources/cities/cities.json`)
- Weather data fetched from FMI Open Data WFS (no API key required)
- FMI request template stored as a Qt resource for cleaner external API configuration
- FMI cloud query template stored as a Qt resource (`:/queries/fmi_cloud_request.txt`)
- Weather point coordinates stored as a Qt resource (`:/queries/weather_coords.txt`)
- Optional cloud coverage overlay generated from FMI WFS `TotalCloudCover` data
- Temperature unit selection (Celsius / Fahrenheit)
- Forecast horizon selection (current / future)
- Automatic weather refresh every 10 minutes
- Weather icons rendered from local SVG assets (FMI WeatherSymbol3)
- Structured logging with **spdlog**
- Clean MVVM architecture with strict separation of layers

---

## FMI Weather Data (No API Key Required)

WeatherMap uses the **FMI Open Data WFS API**, which is fully public and requires:

- no API key  
- no authentication  
- no registration  

WeatherMap also uses FMI Open Data WFS `TotalCloudCover` values for cloud
coverage overlay.

---

## Map & Icon Data Sources

- Map geometry: Natural Earth public-domain data  
- Weather icons: FMI WeatherSymbol3 (MIT license)  
- Weather point coordinates configured through Qt resource `:/queries/weather_coords.txt`
- FMI request templates and query resources under `resources/queries/`
- All assets are stored locally under `resources/`

## Architecture

This project follows an MVVM architecture combined with Clean architecture principles.

![Architecture](resources/architecture.png)

### Architecture decisions
- Layered design: Data -> Domain -> ViewModel -> View (plus Shared types).
- Data layer handles external IO/parsing; domain contains app rules and transformations; viewmodels handle presentation state and async orchestration; views handle rendering only.
- Dependency direction is one-way: UI depends on domain abstractions, domain has no UI dependency.
- This separation improves testability, modularity, maintainability, and readability.


### **Domain Layer** (`include/domain/`)
Pure business logic, no Qt dependencies.

- `CityService`
- `WeatherService`
- `CoordinateNormalizer`
- `MapService`
- `CloudCoverageService`
- `ICloudCoverageRepository`

### **Data Layer** (`include/data/`)
External data access and parsing.

- `CityLoader`
- `GeoJsonFileProvider`
- `WeatherRepository`
- `WeatherCache`
- `NetworkClient`
- `FmiXmlParser`
- `CloudCoverageRepository`

### **ViewModel Layer** (`include/viewmodel/`)
Presentation logic, Qt signals, async operations.

- `MapLoaderViewModel`
- `CityLabelsViewModel`
- `WeatherDataViewModel`
- `CloudOverlayViewModel`

### **View Layer** (`include/view/`)
Qt Widgets UI.

- `MainWindow`
- `MapWidget`

### **Shared Layer** (`include/shared/`)
Utilities and common types.

- `Result<T>`
- `BoundingBox`
- `TemperatureUnit`
- `ForecastHorizon`
- `Logger` (spdlog)

---

## Requirements

- C++20
- Qt 6 (Widgets, Network, Concurrent, Svg)
- CMake ≥ 3.16

---

## Build and Run

### Standard build

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./bin/WeatherMap
```

### Using helper script

```bash
./build_test_and_run.sh
```

This script:
- Configures the build
- Builds all targets
- Runs the full test suite
- Launches WeatherMap

---

## Testing
WeatherMap includes a full test suite covering all layers of the application. Each test component is compiled into its own independent test executable.

### Test Structure

```text
tests/
├── data/
├── domain/
├── view/
└── viewmodel/
```

### Running tests manually

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```

---

## Logging

The application uses structured logging with spdlog:

- Initialization: Logger setup at application startup
- Service lifecycle: Service creation and initialization logs
- Map loading: Detailed progress of map data loading and processing
- Error handling: Clear error messages for debugging

Log output includes timestamps, log levels, and contextual information.

## Static Code Analysis (cppcheck)

Static analysis is integrated into CI using cppcheck.
